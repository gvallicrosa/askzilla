# AskZilla
A small terminal question game.

AskZilla keeps asking random questions from those introduced. 
If the question is wrongly answered or the timeout is reached, 
the user needs to wait a specified time before being able to start again.

Very competitive when played between different teams.

## Requeriments

* python >= 2.7 (not tested in 3, but should work) 

## Configuration
Edit the `config.py` file to include your custom questions and other options.

## Usage
Start with `./start.sh`.
